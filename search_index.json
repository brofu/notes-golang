Actually, the slice header is the struct of slice itself above mentioned.\n// SliceHeader is the runtime representation of a slice.\n// It cannot be used safely or portably and its representation may\n// change in a later release.\n// Moreover, the Data field is not sufficient to guarantee the data\n// it references will not be garbage collected, so programs must keep\n// a separate, correctly typed pointer to the underlying data.\ntype SliceHeader struct {\n    Data uintptr\n    Len  int\n    Cap  int\n}\nOk, let's understand these 2 addresses with dlv debugger.\nTwo Addresses - string slice\nLet's use this piece code to understand these 2 addresses. First, let's look at string slice\nfunc StringSliceAddresses() {\n\n    a := make([]string, 0, 2)\n    fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    a = append(a, \"a1\")\n    fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n\n    b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n    b[0] = \"b0\"\n    fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    b = append(b, \"b2\")\n    fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n\n}\nIn this code gist, fmt.Println(\"%p, %p\\n\", a, &a), would print the addresses of the array under layer and the slice header\nLet's use the dlv tool to verify this.\n\nLaunch the main.go with dlv tool. You may do this by:\n\ndlv debug main.go\nb main.main // set breakpoint at entry point\n\nAnd then, let's exam the memory of a \n\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringSliceAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:10 (PC: 0x10aea9f)\n     5: )\n     6:\n     7: func StringSliceAddresses() {\n     8:\n     9:         a := make([]string, 0, 2)\n=>  10:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    11:         a = append(a, \"a1\")\n    12:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    13:\n    14:         b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n    15:         b[0] = \"b0\"\n(dlv) n\na: 0xc0000be000, 0xc0000ac018   // NOTE: here, we got 2 addresses\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringSliceAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:11 (PC: 0x10aeb8c)\n     6:\n     7: func StringSliceAddresses() {\n     8:\n     9:         a := make([]string, 0, 2)\n    10:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n=>  11:         a = append(a, \"a1\")\n    12:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    13:\n    14:         b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n    15:         b[0] = \"b0\"\n    16:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n(dlv) p *(*string)(0xc0000be000)       //NOTE: we print the 1st evelement in the array, and we don't have any element yet\n\"\"\n(dlv) p *(*unsafeheader.Slice)(0xc0000ac018)\ninternal/unsafeheader.Slice {Data: unsafe.Pointer(0xc0000be000), Len: 0, Cap: 2} //NOTE: we print the `SliceHeader`, by the address of a \n(dlv) n\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringSliceAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:12 (PC: 0x10aec3d)\n     7: func StringSliceAddresses() {\n     8:\n     9:         a := make([]string, 0, 2)\n    10:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    11:         a = append(a, \"a1\")\n=>  12:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    13:\n    14:         b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n    15:         b[0] = \"b0\"\n    16:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    17:         b = append(b, \"b2\")\n(dlv) n\na: 0xc0000be000, 0xc0000ac018   //NOTE: the address of the array under layer doens't change.\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringSliceAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:14 (PC: 0x10aed2c)\n     9:         a := make([]string, 0, 2)\n    10:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    11:         a = append(a, \"a1\")\n    12:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    13:\n=>  14:         b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n    15:         b[0] = \"b0\"\n    16:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    17:         b = append(b, \"b2\")\n    18:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    19:\n(dlv) p *(*string)(0xc0000be000)\n\"a1\"   //NOTE: now, we have the 1st element \"a1\"\n(dlv) p *(*unsafeheader.Slice)(0xc0000ac018)\ninternal/unsafeheader.Slice {Data: unsafe.Pointer(0xc0000be000), Len: 1, Cap: 2}  //NOTE: the length of the array under layer changed.\n\nNow, let's continue with b\n\n(dlv) n\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringSliceAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:15 (PC: 0x10aed87)\n    10:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    11:         a = append(a, \"a1\")\n    12:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    13:\n    14:         b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n=>  15:         b[0] = \"b0\"\n    16:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    17:         b = append(b, \"b2\")\n    18:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    19:\n    20: }\n(dlv) n\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringSliceAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:16 (PC: 0x10aedd2)\n    11:         a = append(a, \"a1\")\n    12:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    13:\n    14:         b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n    15:         b[0] = \"b0\"\n=>  16:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    17:         b = append(b, \"b2\")\n    18:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    19:\n    20: }\n(dlv) n\nb: 0xc0000be020, 0xc0000ac060\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringSliceAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:17 (PC: 0x10aeece)\n    12:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    13:\n    14:         b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n    15:         b[0] = \"b0\"\n    16:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n=>  17:         b = append(b, \"b2\")\n    18:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    19:\n    20: }\n(dlv) p *(*string)(0xc0000be020)\n\"b0\"  //NOTE: we have \"b0\"\n(dlv) p *(*unsafeheader.Slice)(0xc0000ac060)\ninternal/unsafeheader.Slice {Data: unsafe.Pointer(0xc0000be020), Len: 2, Cap: 2} //NOTE: the `Slice Header` data\n\n(dlv) n\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringSliceAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:18 (PC: 0x10aef7f)\n    13:\n    14:         b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n    15:         b[0] = \"b0\"\n    16:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    17:         b = append(b, \"b2\")\n=>  18:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    19:\n    20: }\n(dlv) n\nb: 0xc0000b8040, 0xc0000ac060  //NOTE: the address of the array under layer changed.

Considering that, the length of pointer (to string) on a 64bit system should be 8? \nLet's discuss this in next section.\nTwo Addresses - string\nThe answer to above mentioned question is, the data stored in the under layer array, is the String Header itself, instead of the pointer to the string (presented by a String Header) \nHow to understand this?\n\nstring in golang is just a read-only slice of bytes\nIt's presented by reflect.StringHeader, which contains a pointer to the data and length, each takes 8 bytes on 64 bit system\nIn the under layer array of string slice, the StringHeader itself is stored. (Instead of a pointer pointing to it)\n\nThe refelct.StringHeader: \n// StringHeader is the runtime representation of a string.\n// It cannot be used safely or portably and its representation may\n// change in a later release.\n// Moreover, the Data field is not sufficient to guarantee the data\n// it references will not be garbage collected, so programs must keep\n// a separate, correctly typed pointer to the underlying data.\ntype StringHeader struct {\n    Data uintptr\n    Len  int\n}\nSo actually there are 2 addresses for string also. And the hidden address is pointing to the under layer read-only bytes array\n(dlv) n\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:25 (PC: 0x10aea7a)\n    20:\n    21: }\n    22:\n    23: func StringAddresses() {\n    24:         a := \"test\"\n=>  25:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p\\n\", &a)\n    26: }\n    27:\n    28: func IntegerSliceAddresses() {\n    29:\n    30:         a := make([]int, 2, 2)                                                                                                                 (dlv) n                                                                                                                                                a: 0xc000010250\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:26 (PC: 0x10aeae5)\n    21: }                                                                                                                                                  22:                                                                                                                                                    23: func StringAddresses() {                                                                                                                           24:         a := \"test\"\n    25:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p\\n\", &a)\n=>  26: }\n    27:\n    28: func IntegerSliceAddresses() {\n    29:\n    30:         a := make([]int, 2, 2)\n    31:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n(dlv) p *(*unsafeheader.String)(0xc000010250)\ninternal/unsafeheader.String {Data: unsafe.Pointer(0x10c67b7), Len: 4}  //NOTE: the address of bytes array is 0x10c67b7\nTwo Addresses - integer slice\nSimilar mechanism for integer slice.

How does an empty and non-empty store such above mentioned 2 parts?\nThe Under Layer Struct for Empty and Non-Empty Interface\nLet's check the source code with version v1.23\n// go1.23/src/runtime/runtime2.go\n\ntype itab = abi.ITab\ntype _type = abi.Type\n\ntype iface struct { // presentation of non-empty interface\n    tab  *itab\n    data unsafe.Pointer\n}\n\ntype eface struct { // presentation of empty interface\n    _type *_type\n    data  unsafe.Pointer\n}\n\n// go1.23/src/internal/abi/type.go\n\n// Type is the runtime representation of a Go type.\n//\n// Be careful about accessing this type at build time, as the version\n// of this type in the compiler/linker may not have the same layout\n// as the version in the target binary, due to pointer width\n// differences and any experiments.

Keeps the specific interface type\nType. Same as the Type in eface, keep the concrete Type of the data it holds\nFun. Keeps the functions (an array of functions) implemented by the data. Yes, you are right, all the methods defined by the interface should be present here.\n\n\n\nHow Is the Method-Call for a Non-Empty Interface Processed\nSo, for an non-empty interface, what's workflow when we call an method based on it? Let's check this code \ntype People interface {\n    Name() string\n    Work() string\n}\n\ntype Teacher struct{}\n\nfunc (t *Teacher) Name() string {\n    return \"teacher\"\n}\n\nfunc (t *Teacher) Work() string {\n    return \"teach\"\n}\n\ntype Student struct{}\n\nfunc (s *Student) Name() string {\n    return \"student\"\n}\n\nfunc (s *Student) Work() string {\n    return \"study\"\n}\n\nfunc showExampleMethodCallV2(ctx context.Context) {\n    for _, p := range []People{&Teacher{}, &Student{}} {\n        fmt.Println(\"method call:\", p.Work())\n        fmt.Println(\"method call:\", p.Name())\n    }\n}\nPlease note, there are 2 key points of these code snippet. And we would explain this later.\n\nThere is a slice of People, with 2 different concrete types, say that, Student and Teacher.\nWork() method is defined secondly, but called firstly, while Name() is reverse. \n\nOK. In short, the workflow would be (roughly) like this:\n\nGet the method pointer (Name() or Work()) from the iface.*table.Fun\nGet the concrete data pointer by iface.data\nCall the method with concrete data as the 1st parameter\n\nLet's verify this by debugging the above code snippet.\nThe debugging info showed as following, when calling p.Work().

And there is NO procedure of getting the address triggered.\n\nWork() method is defined secondly, but called firstly, while Name() is reverse. \n\nThis is key reason why the address of Name() is 24(R3), while that of Work() is 32(R2). Let's back to the definition of runtime.itab\ntype ITab struct {\n    Inter *InterfaceType\n    Type  *Type\n    Hash  uint32     // copy of Type.Hash. Used for type switches.\n    Fun   [1]uintptr // variable sized. fun[0]==0 means Type does not implement Inter.\n}\nAfter memory padding, the actual layout of ITab is like this \ntype ITab struct {\n    Inter *Interfacetype // 8 bytes, offset 0\n    Type *Type           // 8 bytes, offset 8\n    hash  uint32         // 4 bytes, offset 16\n    _     [4]byte        // 4 bytes, offset 20, padding for alignment\n    Fun   [1]uintptr     // offset 24, start of method pointers, its length depends on the method number of the interface, and each pointer has the size of 8 bytes\n}\nSo, the offset of the 1st method (in the order of definition in the interface, here, it's People) Name() is start_address + 24, and \nThe offset of the 2nd method Work() is start_address + 32.\nAnother Story For Method Call to Non-Empty Interface\nWe just talked about the way of method call on non-empty interface like this \nfunc showExampleMethodCallV2(ctx context.Context) {\n    for _, p := range []People{&Teacher{}, &Student{}} {\n        fmt.Println(\"method call:\", p.Work())\n        fmt.Println(\"method call:\", p.Name())\n    }\n}\nNow, let's check a different one, say that, \nfunc showExampleMethodCallV3(ctx context.Context) {\n    for _, p := range []interface{}{&Teacher{}, &Student{}} {\n        people := p.(People)\n        fmt.Println(\"method call:\", people.Work())\n        fmt.Println(\"method call:\", people.Name())\n    }\n}\nThe difference of this version is that, the slice type is actually []interface{}, and before the method Name() orWork() is called, a type assertion is necessary.\nLet's debug this to find out the under layer story.

(The key point are marked as Key Point x in the comments)\n\nWhen the people := p.(People) is called, the runtime.typeAssert() function is triggered. And following the runtime.getitab() function. (Refer to Key Point 1 and Key Point 2)\n**Within the process of runtime.getitab, if we check the type of the 2 parameters inter and typ, we can tell that, \nThe inter is actually the type of interface People and\nthe typ is actually the type of Teacher**\n\n\n\nYes, that's the 2nd story, when there is type assertion relevant call, such as people := p.(People). \nIn this story function of runtime.getitab(inter *interfacetype, typ *_type, canfail bool) *itab, would be involved, to determine if the assertion succeed, and get the itab object, with which, the method based on the interface People can be executed. \nAnd during this process, itab.Hash would be helpful. Actually, there is a global itab cache named itabTable, which holds the itabs. And the key of it, is itab.Hash\nThere is one more question need to pay attention. That's the offset of the type name. For example, when we check the info about typ parameter, we do like this:\n(dlv) p firstmoduledata.types + 22497\n4340389857\n(dlv) x -fmt hex -count 1 -size 1 4340389858\n0x102b517e2:   0x1b\n(dlv) x -fmt raw -count 27 -size 1 4340389859\nWe get the address by offset, and check the index 1th for the length of the name, and get the real name from index 2nd for the real name.  \nThat's how the runtime handle the Type.Str. Refer to the code\ntype rtype struct {\n    *abi.Type // embedding is okay here (unlike reflect) because none of this is public\n}\n\nfunc (t rtype) string() string {\n    s := t.nameOff(t.Str).Name()\n    if t.TFlag&abi.TFlagExtraStar != 0 {\n        return s[1:]\n    }\n    return s\n}\n\n// Name returns the tag string for n, or empty if there is none.\nfunc (n Name) Name() string {\n    if n.Bytes == nil {\n        return \"\"\n    }\n    i, l := n.ReadVarint(1)\n    return unsafe.String(n.DataChecked(1+i, \"non-empty string\"), l)\n}\nThe magic lies in line i, l := n.ReadVarint(1). In our case, i would be 1, and l is the really length of the type name. For Teacher and Student, is 27 and People, 26.\nIn short, the layout would be like this:\n[0] byte: flags\n[1] byte: length\n[2:]     : UTF-8 string of that length\nReferences\n\nGolang Source Code V1.23\n\n"},"01-specification/02-interface/200-delegation-pattern.html":{"url":"01-specification/02-interface/200-delegation-pattern.html","title":"Delegation Pattern","keywords":"","body":"Delegation Pattern\nConcepts\n\nDelegation means: \"I'm not implementing this method myself, but instead I'm passing the call to another object that knows how.\"\n\nIn Go, delegation is commonly implemented through:\n\nStruct embedding (automatic delegation)\nExplicit forwarding (manual delegation)\n\nBut with interface, we may have better flexible and extensible\nAn Example\nLet's say that,  we have an set of integers, we can add or remove number from it.\ntype IntSet struct {\n    data map[int]struct{}\n}\n\nfunc NewIntSet() IntSet {\n    return IntSet{make(map[int]struct{})}\n}\n\nfunc (set *IntSet) Add(x int) {\n    set.data[x] = struct{}{}\n}\n\nfunc (set *IntSet) Delete(x int) {\n    delete(set.data, x)\n}\nAnd now, we need an Undo feature to IntSet. That's to say, remove the added number with Undo, or add the removed number with it. We may do that like this\nDefine the Undoer interface and implement it \ntype Undoer interface {\n    Trace(func())\n    Undo() error\n}\n\ntype DefaultUndoer []func()\n\nfunc (du *DefaultUndoer) Trace(f func()) {\n    *du = append(*du, f)\n}\n\nfunc (du *DefaultUndoer) Undo() error {\n    if len(*du) == 0 {\n        return errors.New(\"no function traced\")\n    }\n\n    f := (*du)[len(*du)-1]\n    if f != nil {\n        f()\n    }\n\n    *du = (*du)[:len(*du)-1]\n    return nil\n}\nUtilize the new interface\ntype IntSetWithUndo struct {\n    IntSet\n    Undoer\n}\n\nfunc NewIntSetWithUndo() IntSetWithUndo {\n    return IntSetWithUndo{\n        NewIntSet(),\n        new(DefaultUndoer),\n    }\n}\n\nfunc (set *IntSetWithUndo) Add(x int) {\n    set.IntSet.Add(x)\n    set.Undoer.Trace(func() {\n        set.IntSet.Delete(x)\n    })\n}\n\nfunc (set *IntSetWithUndo) Delete(x int) {\n    set.IntSet.Delete(x)\n    set.Undoer.Trace(func() {\n        set.IntSet.Add(x)\n    })\n}\n\nfunc (set *IntSetWithUndo) Undo() error {\n    return set.Undoer.Undo()\n}\nWith this we can gain the benefits, \n\nNo modification to the IntSet.

It's memory waist definitely.

The whole definition is like that \n// go1.23/src/runtime/runtime2.go\n\ntype iface struct {\n    tab  *itab\n    data unsafe.Pointer\n}\nThe ITab.Hash has only 4 bytes. So on the 64bit CPU platform, there would be memory padding for it for the memory alignment. But why NOT define ITab.Func before ITab.Hash, so that it can save around 4 bytes from padding? \nThat's because Fun [1]uintptr is actually a placeholder for a dynamically sized array of method function pointers. And the runtime would actually append more memory space at the end of the ITab struct.\nReferences\n\nGolang Source Code v1.23\nGemini-2.5-pro\n\n"},"01-specification/generics.html":{"url":"01-specification/generics.html","title":"Generics","keywords":"","body":"Generics\nUsage Scenarios\nCase 1\nThe Situation\nLet's see one example \n// An interface Human\ntype Human interface {\n    Name() string\n}\n\n// An Implementation to Human interface \ntype Hero struct {\n    name string\n}\nfunc (h *Hero) Name() string {\n    return h.name\n}\n\n// A function would say hello to Human interface\nfunc SayHello(humans []Human) {\n    for _, human := range humans {\n        fmt.Prinln(\"Hello, \", human.Name())\n    }\n}\n\n// Call the function with Hero lists\nfunc main() {\n    heroList := []*Hero{&Hero{name: \"thor\"}, &Hero{name: \"apolo\"}}\n    // This doesn't work\n    // cannot use heroList (variable of type []*Hero) as []Human value in argument to SayHello\n    SayHello(heroList) // This doesn't work\n}\nThe Reason\n\nThere is a general rule that syntax should not hide complext/costly operations\n\nOptions\nOne option for this it to use the Generics which is introduced from 1.18\n// new version with Go Generics\nfunc SayHelloV2[T Human](humans []T) {\n    for _, human := range humans {\n        fmt.Println(\"Hello, \", human.Name())\n    }\n}\n\n// call the new function\nSayHelloV2[*Hero](heroList)\nPons and Cons of Go Generics \nReference\nhttps://dusted.codes/using-go-generics-to-pass-struct-slices-for-interface-slices\nhttps://go.dev/blog/intro-generics\n"},"02-runtime/readme.html":{"url":"02-runtime/readme.html","title":"Runtime","keywords":"","body":"Golang Under Layer Implementations\nIn this section, we would look at the internal, under layer implementations of Golang.

The marking phase identifies which objects are still reachable from the root set (global variables, stack variables, etc.). Objects that are still in use are marked as reachable.\nSweeping. After marking, the sweeping phase begins. This phase reclaims the memory occupied by unreachable objects and returns it to the heap for future allocations.  \nPacing. The GC dynamically adjusts its pace based on the application's allocation rate. This adaptive pacing ensures that garbage collection keeps up with the application's memory usage without introducing significant pauses\n\nMarking\nTri-color Marking Algorithm\nRoles\nObjects are marked with 3 colors, \n\nwhite (unreachable),  \ngray (reachable but not fully processed), and \nblack (reachable and fully processed). \n\nWorkflow\n\nInital State \nInitially, all objects in the heap are conceptually white. \nThe GC starts with a small number of roots, which are marked grepy and added to the grey set\nRoots are the entry points to the object graph (global variables, stack variables, and registers).\n\n\nMarking Phase\nThe algorithm processes each gray node by marking it black and processing its references. \nIf a referenced node is white, it is marked gray and added to the gray set.\nRepeat this process.\nThis process is running concurrently and incrementally.\n\n\nMarking Completion\nWhen the gray set is empty, all reachable nodes are black.\nAny remaining white nodes are unreachable and can be reclaimed by the garbage collector.\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\nThe STW time is very short. How?\nConcurrent Marking.  The Go GC is concurrent, meaning it can run alongside the application (mutator). \nIncremental Marking. The marking work is broken down into small chunks, and the objects are being marked incrementally. \n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nHow make sure all the objects are correctly marked? (Given that the marking progress is running concurrently with the application)\n\nThe GC uses a `write barrier to ensure that any changes to object references made by the application are correctly tracked during the marking phase.\nTri-Color Invariant\nNo black object points to a white object. This ensures that all reachable objects are eventually marked.\nIf a gray object points to a white object, the white object is also marked gray.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Golang GC can NOT remove the STW event totally?\nThere are several scenarios the GC need to STW to make sure the process correctly.\na. Roots Scan.\n\nRoots of All goroutines need to scan, which includes global variables, local variables and registers. In a concurrent system like Go, where multiple goroutines are running, each goroutine’s stack and registers may contain references to heap objects. These are part of the root set that needs to be scanned.\nEnsuring Consistency: To get a consistent snapshot of the roots, the GC must pause all goroutines at safe points. This ensures that no references are modified while the GC is scanning the roots, preventing inconsistencies.\n\nb. Write Barriers and Tri-color Invariant\n\nDuring certain phases, the GC may need to apply these write barriers globally, requiring a brief pause to update references and maintain consistency.\n\nc. Concurrent Marking Completion\n\nSTW for another cycle of Roots scan.\nPrepare for the Transition to Sweep Phase. (To make sure the marking is completely finished also. TODO: More checking)\n\n\nAn example of STW event caused by Write Barriers and Tri-color Invariant?\nLet's check this code.\n package main\n\n import (\n     \"runtime\"\n     \"time\"\n )\n\n type Node struct {\n     value int\n     next  *Node\n }\n\n func main() {\n     root := &Node{value: 1}\n     root.next = &Node{value: 2}\n     root.next.next = &Node{value: 3}\n\n     // Start a goroutine that mutates the object graph\n     go func() {\n         for {\n             root.next.next = &Node{value: 4}\n             time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)\n         }\n     }()\n\n     // Trigger periodic garbage collections\n     for i := 0; i \nBefore Mutation: root -> black, root.next -> black, root.next.next -> white \nDuring Mutation: The application changes root.next.next to point to a new node, which is white. The write barrier ensures that the new node is marked gray if it is white, maintaining the tri-color invariant.\nAfter Mutation: The GC can then safely continue its marking phase.\nTODO: More checking\n\n\nIn the question of 3. Is it OK to stop the goroutine which is updating the root.next.next ONLY? Why need to STW?\nTODO: More checking\n\n\nSweeping\n"},"02-runtime/31-gc/01-code.html":{"url":"02-runtime/31-gc/01-code.html","title":"Code","keywords":"","body":""},"02-runtime/31-gc/02-tools.html":{"url":"02-runtime/31-gc/02-tools.html","title":"Tools","keywords":"","body":""},"02-runtime/sync/readme.html":{"url":"02-runtime/sync/readme.html","title":"Sync","keywords":"","body":"sync.Once\nSource Code\ntype Once struct {\n    done uint32\n    m    Mutex\n}\n\nfunc (o *Once) Do(f func()) {\n    if atomic.LoadUint32(&o.done) == 0 { \n        o.doSlow(f)\n    }\n}\n\nfunc (o *Once) doSlow(f func()) {\n    o.m.Lock()\n    defer o.m.Unlock()\n    if o.done == 0 {\n        defer atomic.StoreUint32(&o.done, 1)\n        f()\n    }\n}\nKey Points\n\nA Once must not be copied after first use. Since defer atomic.StoreUint32(&o.done, 1) would update o.done by address\nWhy done is the first?    \n`It is first in the struct because it is used in the hot path. The hot path is inlined at every call site. Placing done first allows more compact instructions on some architectures (amd64/386), and fewer instructions (to calculate offset) on other architectures.\nIn short, o.done is high frequently accessed, put it first would make the performance better. \n\n\nPay attention to Deadlock. Because no call to Do returns until the one call to f returns, if f causes Do to be called, it will deadlock.\nAbout panic. If f panics, Do considers it to have returned; future calls of Do return without calling f. => How? \nWrong version of Once.Do. Why?\nif atomic.CompareAndSwapUint32(&o.done, 0, 1) {\n f()\n}\n\nDo guarantees that when it returns, f has finished. This implementation would not implement that guarantee:\n given two simultaneous calls, the winner of the cas would call f, and the second would return immediately, without waiting for the first's call to f to complete.\n This is why the slow path falls back to a mutex, and why the atomic.StoreUint32 must be delayed until after f returns.\n\nIn short, CAS would return at immediately, but lock would block the call.\n\n\n"},"03-programming_paradigms/readme.html":{"url":"03-programming_paradigms/readme.html","title":"Programming Paradigms","keywords":"","body":""},"04-engineering/readme.html":{"url":"04-engineering/readme.html","title":"Engineering","keywords":"","body":"Tools which can improve the productivity with Golang\nProject Construction\n\ncookiecutter\nConstruct the project construct \nCan customize the template \nhttps://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter\nAn template option: https://github.com/lacion/cookiecutter-golang \n\n\n\nTesting\n\ngotests\nInsert unit test codes based on the templates\nhttps://github.com/cweill/gotests\n\n\nvim-plugin available: https://github.com/buoto/gotests-vim  // install\n  go install github.com/cweill/gotests/gotests@latest\n  // install plugin\n\nNeed to define the templates. \nAn example: https://github.com/ras0q/gotests-template/blob/main/templates2/function.tmpl\n\n\nUsage  :GoTests\n  :GoTestsAll\n\n\n\n\n"},"05-interviews/readme.html":{"url":"05-interviews/readme.html","title":"Interviews","keywords":"","body":"Code Design\nHow to implement singleton in golang\n\nCreate instance at package importing\n\npackage singleton   \n\ntype singletonObject struct {}\nvar singletonObj = &singletonObject{}\n\nfunc GetSingletonObject () *singletonObject {\n    return singletonObj\n}\n\nInstance created when the package is imported.
